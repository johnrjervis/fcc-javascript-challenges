# fcc-javascript-challenges
My solutions to some of the JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp (with tests)

Folder names are based on the fCC courses in which the exercises are found:

JADS = JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
CIP = Coding Interview Prep

I did not create a folder in this repo for any challenges that were simple enough that writing tests seemed redundant (e.g. the creating-an-instance-of-a-JavaScript-set-and-adding-a-few-values challenge in the data structures course in the coding interview prep section); instead, I just completed these challenge directly on fCC. As such, there are gaps for some challenge numbers in some of the courses.
