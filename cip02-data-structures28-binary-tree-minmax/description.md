# Find the minimum and maximum values in a binary search tree

This challenge extends the previous one. The task this time is to create methods for finding the minimum and maximum values in a tree.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the previous challenge. I have also included the tests from the previous challenge as regression tests.
