# Linked list - search

This challenge is an extension of the previous two linked list challenges. The aim here is to add a search methods: specifically an indexOf method, which returns the position of an element within the list and an elemnentAt method, which reports the element that is at a given index in the list. An isEmpty method is also required - this should return a boolean that indicates whether or not the list is empty.

The tests from the previous challenges are retained as regression tests. I have modified some of the code outside of the "only change code below/above this line" comments to prevent my earlier tests from failing. I only submitted the code between the comments to pass the exercise on fCC, however.
