# Linked list - removeAt

This challenge is an extension of the previous linked list challenges. The challenge this time is to add a method that allows an item at a specified index of the list to be removed.

The tests from the first of the linked list challenges are retained as regression tests. Tests from the other (2nd and 3rd) linked list challenges have not been included, because the starting point for this challenge (provided by fCC) does not include the relevant methods. (So tests #10 to #30 are missing from tests.html).
