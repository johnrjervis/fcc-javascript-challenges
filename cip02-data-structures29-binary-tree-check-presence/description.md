# Check whether an item is present in a binary search tree

This is another binary search tree challenge: the task this time is to create a method that returns true if the sought item is present in the tree and false if not.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #23 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
