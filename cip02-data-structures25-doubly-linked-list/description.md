# Doubly linked list

The next data structure is a doubly linked list: each item in the list should be linked to the preceding item in the list as well as the next. The aim of this challenge is to create the methods necessary to add and remove items from the list.

Other requirements for the exercise are that removing an item from an empty list should return null, and that all items in a list that match the argument supplied to the remove method should be removed.

There is a requirement for the remove method to return null is the doubly linked list is empty. My remove function does not feature any return statements, and therefore returns null by default.
