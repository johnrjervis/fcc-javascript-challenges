# Insertion sort

This is another sorting algorithm. This time, the algorithm should loop through an array putting the sorted elements in order at the start of the array. So the element at index 0 will be left in place, then the element at index 1 will be compared with the element at index 0 and moved before it or left after it depending on which of the two is higher. Then the element at index #2 will be compared the element at index #1: if it does not need to be moved it will stay in place, but if it does need to be moved then it will subsequently be compared to the element at index 0.

By iterating through the whole array in this fashion, the array can be sorted.
