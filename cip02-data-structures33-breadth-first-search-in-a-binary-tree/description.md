# Breadth-first search in a binary search tree

This is the seventh binary search tree challenge, and the aim this time is to create two breadth-first search methods for a binary tree. These searches should traverse the tree one depth layer at a time: the first search method (levelOrder) should return each depth layer's node values in left-to-right order, while the second search method (reverseLevelOrder) should return the node values in right-to-left order.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #78 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
