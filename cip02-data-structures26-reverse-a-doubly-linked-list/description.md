# Reversing a doubly linked list

This challenge continues with the doubly linked list that was featured in the previous challenge. The aim this time is to create a method that can reverse a linked list, so that the head and the tail of the list are swapped, as are the prev and next properties of each list item.

I have copied the add method from the previous challenge so that new lists can be created for the purpose of testing.
