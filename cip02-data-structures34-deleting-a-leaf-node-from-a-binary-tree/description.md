# Deleting a leaf node from a binary search tree

This is the eigth binary search tree challenge, and the aim in this one is to create a 'remove' method for deleting leaf nodes from a binary search tree. Since leaf nodes do not have children, there is no need to restore orphaned nodes to the tree structure.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #94 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
