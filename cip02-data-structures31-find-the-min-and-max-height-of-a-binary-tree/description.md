# Find the minimum and maximum height of a binary search tree

This is the fifth binary search tree challenge, in which the aim of the exercise is to calculate the minimum and maximum height ('height' being the distance between any given leaf node and the root node). The difference between the minimum and maximum heights should then be used to calculate whether the tree is balanced - if the difference is one or less, the tree is considered to be balanced.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #40 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
