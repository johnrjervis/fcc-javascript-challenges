# Inverting a binary search tree

This is the eleventh binary search tree challenge. Here, the goal is to create a method for inverting a binary search tree. When the tree is inverted, each node's right child is swapped with its left child.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #128 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
