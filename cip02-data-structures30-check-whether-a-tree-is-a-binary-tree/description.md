# Check whether a tree is a binary search tree

This is the fourth binary search tree challenge: the requirement here is to create a method that checks whether a tree is a binary search tree (or whether it at least follows some of the rules for a binary search tree: the value of a left node should be less than that of it's parent node and the value of the right node should be greater than that of its parent node. For any leaf nodes, the left and right properties should be null.

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #30 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
