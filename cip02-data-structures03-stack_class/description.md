# Create a stack class

The challenge here is to create a class that behaves in the same way as a stack. The requirements are that the class should have push, pop, peek (shows the item at the top of the stack), isEmpty (returns a boolean that indicates whether or not the stack is empty), and clear (empties the stack) methods.
