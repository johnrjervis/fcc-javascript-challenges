# Depth-first search in a binary search tree

This is the sixth binary search tree challenge, and the aim of this one is to create three depth-first search methods for a binary tree. These are: in-order (results ordered from the left-most node to the right-most node), pre-order (ordered from the root node to the leaf nodes), and post-order (ordered from the leaf nodes to the root node).

To create new trees for my tests, I have retained the add method from the first binary search tree challenge; I have also included the tests from that challenge as regression tests.

The tests start from #57 - I am (re)using a single set of numbers for all of the binary search tests.
