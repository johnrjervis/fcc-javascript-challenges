# Create a queue class

For this challenge, the goal is to create a class that behaves in the same way as a queue. The requirements are that the class should have enqueue, dequeue, front (shows the item at the front of the queue), size (returns the length of the queue), and isEmpty (returns a boolean that indicates whether or not the stack is empty) methods.
