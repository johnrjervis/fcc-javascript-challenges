# Bubble sort

This sorting algorithm works by iterating through an array comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if required. The algorithm keeps looping through the array until it reaches a point where no further changes are required. I chose to do this recursively: I used a single loop in the sorting function (instead of a double loop as would be required in a non-recursive solution), and called the function on the sorted result unless no changes had been made.
